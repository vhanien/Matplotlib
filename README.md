# Three Data Observations
1. Volume of mice tumors decreased significantly over time as seen with mice taking Capomulin
2. Survival rates were almost 2x higher for mice on Capomulin
3. The weight of the mouse was highly correlated with their tumor size (almost perfectly correlated)

In this excercise I have been given access to the complete data from a pharmacutical's most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. I have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study.
